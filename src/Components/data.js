It has to be accepted that there are fewer opportunities to get a job and she used this time for volunteering and now she has proudly become a part of the kindness team The Kindness Shake, where she has found great friends and have good connections. You will also probably meet her as a volunteer two days per week at RSPCA, where she cares for friendly dogs seeking adoption.
