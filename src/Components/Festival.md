Darwin community has been through bumps and jumps in the past year, particularly international students. Many international students in Darwin have felt stranded and isolated, as we are all away from our homes and families.

_However, the pandemic has not stopped a group of international students from finding ways to support each other and our beloved Darwin community. KS is excited to announce the inaugural Kindness Festival “Celebrating Our Diversity”, which aims to showcase the importance and value of international students in the NT while portraying the endless ways the community can work together, regardless of the difficult time the world is experiencing._

**Mark your calendars now: Saturday 31 July 2021 at the Darwin Waterfront Precinct: the inaugural Kindness Festival “Celebrating Our Diversity”**

_The Kindness Festival is brought to you thanks to the support of the Northern Territory Government and the Darwin Waterfront Corporation._
