# Volunteers Expression of Interest

As you all may already know, we are getting ready for our Kindness Festival that will happen onÂ July 31stÂ at the Waterfront. It will be a day-long event full of fun activitiesÂ ðŸ™‚

To bring this event to life we will need volunteers to donate some of their very generous time for event set-up, and the running of the event on the day, as we always sayÂ *"Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much"*Â - your help is what keeps this organization growing and we appreciate you all so much.
